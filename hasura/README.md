# Clowdr: Hasura

We use the Hasura GraphQL engine to power the interface between the frontend
and all of our backend services.

## Pre-requisites

1. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
1. [Hasura CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/core/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.html)

## Setting Up

1. `cp hasura/.env.example hasura/.env.local`
1. In `hasura/docker-compose.yaml`, comment out the line `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET: ${HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET}`. We'll re-enable it once we have a JWT secret.
1. Run the `Hasura Console -- Local Development` task within VSCode:
   `Terminal > Run Task`.
1. Check that the Docker Compose task ran successfully in the Task Output
1. Check that the Hasura Console task ran successfully in the Task Output
    - If you get an error message about `version check: failed to get
      version from server: failed making version api call...` try running
      the task again -- there is a race condition that can cause this.
1. Your browser should have opened a tab to the Hasura console

Now return to the main README.

## Local Development

See root ReadMe instructions for local development for which tasks to run.

**Note**: If the environment configuration for Hasura/Postgres or the Docker
Compose configuration change, then the Hasura local-dev tasks will need to
be restarted (which will also apply the changes to Docker).

## Remote Deployment

We use GitHub Actions (a.k.a. Workflows) to automatically deploy new versions
to Hasura Cloud and run migrations.
