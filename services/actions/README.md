# Clowdr: Actions Service

Express server designed to run on Heroku and serves action calls from Hasura.
Eventually this may be split into multiple microservices.

## Pre-requisities

1. [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
1. You have followed the AWS setup instructions in [aws/README.md](../../aws/README.md)
1. You have created a [SendGrid](https://www.sendgrid.com) account and an API key for it.
1. You have create a [Vonage Video API](https://www.vonage.co.uk/communications-apis/video/) account and an API key for it.
1. You have deployed the [Image Handler](#deploying-the-image-handler) stack.
1. You have created a [Google Cloud](#creating-a-google-cloud-project) project.

## Deploying the image handler

We use the AWS `serverless-image-handler` template for processing uploaded profile images. These are the steps to deploy it:

1. Create a new secret in AWS Secrets Manager - you can use any secret name and secret key you like. Choose a secure random string and make a note of it.
1. In AWS CloudFormation, create a stack from the template `https://solutions-reference.s3.amazonaws.com/serverless-image-handler/latest/serverless-image-handler.template`
1. Choose the Stack name to be something unique, preferably using your `AWS_PREFIX`.
1. Set the parameters as follows:

- `CorsEnabled`: Yes
- `CorsOrigin`: `http://localhost` if running locally, or an appropriate origin.
- `SourceBuckets`: the name of your content bucket (i.e. `AWS_CONTENT_BUCKET_ID`)
- `DeployDemoUI`: No
- `LogRetentionPeriod`: 1
- `EnableSignature`: Yes
- `SecretsManagerSecret`: the name of the secret you created earlier
- `SecretsManagerKey`: the key of the secret you created earlier
- `EnableDefaultFallbackImage`: No
- `AutoWebP`: Yes

1. Deploy the stack and wait for creation to copmlete.
1. Make a note of the `ApiEndpoint` output.

# Creating a Google Cloud project

We use a Google Cloud project to provide access to the YouTube Data API with OAuth2.

1. Create a new project in Google Cloud Platform.
1. Enable the [YouTube Data API v3](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/youtube.googleapis.com)
1. Create a mew [OAuth 2.0 Client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
1. Set the _Authorised JavaScript origins_ `URIs` to the URI at which the frontend is hosted.
1. Set _Authorised redirect URIs_ `URIs` to the `<frontend uri>/googleoauth`.

## Setting Up

1. Copy the `services/actions/.env.example` to `services/actions/.env`
1. Configure your `.env` according to the [Actions Service
   Configuration](#actions-service-configuration) table below
   - You will need the outputs from running the AWS CDK deployment

## Local Development

See root ReadMe instructions for local development for which tasks to run.

If the environment configuration changes, or for example, the `package.json`
commands change, then you will need to restart tasks for this microservice.

## Testing

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) and
[SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest). SuperTest provides an easy
way to test the express server functions.

## Remote Deployment

Heroku apps are linked to the repo and pull from the branches listed below.

| Branch  | Heroku App |
| ------- | ---------- |
| develop | ci-testing |
| staging | staging    |
| main    | production |

Heroku deployment is a little tricky because this is a monorepo.

- A single heroku app will have multiple containers, one or more for each
  microservice. The root `Procfile` is what Heroku uses to identify what
  services to start and thus which scripts to run.
- The `heroku-postbuild` script in the root `package.json` overrides Heroku Node
  Buildpack's default build task so that we can build each micro-service
  independently.
- The `postinstall` script in the root `package.json` not only makes development
  installs easier, but is essential for Heroku to successfully install and
  manage packages in the root and all micro-services.

## Notes

- The `package.json` in the `clowdr` root directory uses an NPM post-install
  hook to install dependencies in this directory too.
  - This is also necessary for the Heroku build
- The `Procfile` is used by Heroku to start this service. It exists in the
  `clowdr` root directory points at the compiled `build/server.js`.

## Heroku App Configuration

Connect to Github for auto-deployment of a branch. Configure environment
variables according to [the table below](#actions-service-configuration).
